# Structural Analysis N,Q I

	To perform structural analysis in binary unipartite and bipartite networks
    	by means of nestedness (as defined in ASR et al, PRE 2018), in-block nested and modularity.
    
        
    	Inputs:
    	----------
       
           	path-folder =  directory where the network data files are. The data files with .csv file extension. It can be either in edge list or adjacency matrix format with no headers. 
           	bipartite =  boolean to indicate if "filename" is a bipartite (True) or unipartite (False) network
           	edge_data = boolean indicating the format of the data file. Three-column/edge list (True) or matrix format (False)
	output:
	-------
		The function return  two .csv files for each generated network containing the label partitions from the Modularity
		and in-block nestednesss analysis.
		
		another .csv file containing a table with name, nested value, Q value, and I value
		the networks
	
	If for example we pass bipartite=True and edge_data=True, all 
	the networks we want to analyze have to fulfill such conditions.

  	example: python structural_analysis.py home/User/data/ True False

# Nestedness and In-block nestedness

Both metrics are computed considering the condition $k_i>=k_j$ to compared the paired overlap between pairs of nodes in contrast with the NODF metrics that consider $k_i>k_j$

# Modularity and in-block nestedness optimization

The optimization of modularity and in-block nestedness was perform by employing the Extremal optimization algorithm [1](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.72.027104).
The main code for this function was written in c++ and should be compiled as a file with a .so extension for Python 3.x. This file will be imported to python as a library. 

This will possible whether you are using MacOS or Linux.

## Manual Compilation

### System Requirements 	
	#### Compilers 

		1) Clang/LLVM 3.3 or newer (for Apple Xcode's clang, this is 5.0.0 or newer) or
		2) GCC 4.8 or newer

	 Python 3.x 
	 pybind11 

### To compile the c++ files 

	#### Compilation on Linux: 
```
		2)  g++ -O3 -Wall -shared -std=c++11 -fPIC `python -m pybind11 --includes` EO_functions_bipartite.cpp -o extremal_bi.so
```
	
	#### Compilation on MacOS: 
```
		2) g++ -O3 -Wall -shared -std=c++11 -undefined dynamic_lookup `python -m pybind11 --includes` EO_functions_bipartite.cpp -o extremal_bi.so
```
